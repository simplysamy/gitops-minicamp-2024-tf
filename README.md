# GitOps with Terraform 2024 Starter Code

## Cloudformation

The code in the ./cloudformation directory is optional. It is to configure the OIDC role used to authenticate your GitHub Actions workflows to AWS. 

## Terraform

The code in the ./terraform directory is the starter code for the course. This code isn't perfect, and that's intentional! You may need to make modifications to ensure it is reliable and resilient.
